I am older and I have been on kind of an alternative path for most of my career. I taught pre-K for seven years, some of those spent running my own community cottage preschool at home. I taught college for two years. At one time, when I was happiest, I worked with toddlers during the day and taught adults in the evening. But there was one huge problem...there was little money or security in this. 

So I went and got a second Master’s degree to be a secondary teacher. My motivation was for the benefits and the salary and security. Everything else about it I strategically avoided for nearly a decade because I knew it wasn’t going to be a good fit. My undergrad advisors suggested that I find an alternative teaching route. I tried. It didn’t work out. So to secondary I went. 

I love the kids. I love my colleagues. I love my school. But I hate working with the grade level group I’ve been assigned to. In every other teaching situation I have been in, I have been a lone wolf. Of course, there were standards and guidelines to follow but I was at near full creative liberty to interpret and implement them. My first year in secondary ended up being as a special educator with emphasis in my content area after a student teaching experience that had a special Ed emphasis and so I fell in love with creating differentiated content and catering to exceptionalities on either end of the spectrum. I got moved to general Ed in my content area this year and it has been miserable. 

The department chair is a textbook narcissist who wants to be an administrator. She is in charge not only of the department but also every single facet of anything there is to be in charge of. She is unfriendly and acts like everyone is beneath her, especially me. Needless to say, she is not interested in creativity or innovation. I discovered that an alarming number of students were unable to perform basic grammar tasks; there were too many of them to bother with, I was told. I raised concerns that the material being churned out was too difficult for the struggling kids and too simple for the advanced kids; I was told, the advanced kids really aren’t advanced, they are just kids whose families make them do their homework. I researched my data and uncovered areas of weakness in reading and writing I wanted to spend the final quarter remediating due to the pandemic and how in the pacing guide there was a specific call for remediation; I was told that at some point this person and other important people got together and decided that the final quarter would be for research alone. I went to our reading specialist and got a strategy from her to help students who read at a lower grade level manage to understand grade level passages on our state’s standardized testing that was coming soon and I created an application for it; I was told, it’s too late for them to learn this. I asked for the meeting to be held off for a day so I could break it down even further because I really believed in it and I trusted the reading specialist; it was only after an intense argument and involvement of the principal that I was “allowed” to include this. Remediation and efforts to teach are apparently boxes to check off. We have to cover this; we covered this; move on. I get that, but the approach of let’s throw this at the students and hope it sticks to some of them has a lot to do with how students end up in middle school with a first grade reading level. 

I have created so much content before meetings because we are expected to show up with it and spent so much time and effort only to have this person dismiss it because as the department chair she has the power to veto anything she doesn’t like.  By the way, she doesn’t even have a degree in this field. She is an elementary teacher who has been at this at this school for two years and is just really adept at bossing people around and being the most disliked person in the school by students and colleagues alike. She asks for feedback only to tell you why you’re wrong in what you said. So finally today, she asked about some piece of content for remediation that in my opinion was too dense and too abstract for struggling students to get it. Clearly, you taught it that way the first time and it didn’t work; it’s time for something new. These kids aren’t going to receive it for the second time the way they didn’t the first. I simply said that I felt it was too abstract and that there needed to be a way for it to be more concrete for struggling students. She wanted a specific example of this, I.e. a presentation of a body of work to be put together that would have been shit on and dismissed. So I simply said, it needs to be something that the kids can do, not just read about. I asked her to interpret it as she would and I would be glad to look at any work she produced. She finally wrote back and copied the principal (who I was already talking to about the fact that I cannot deal with her and I needed to be moved ad far away from her as possible and I was on the verge of quitting) and the other group member (who has no business being in the middle of this) saying I was withholding ideas and refusing to provide material and I was in violation of the group norms. The principal wisely wrote back and said, enough. We’ve all had enough of each other. We will deal with this after break. 

I’m just fucking over it. I am thinking of giving this up and reverting to homeschooling my own kids and possibly starting a small cottage school for family friends who don’t want public school but can’t afford private. I want to be able to use my own experience and creativity to plan my lessons and help children grow from where they are to where they need to be. I welcome having standards of learning, but I do not wish to be told how to apply them. I do not enjoy being handed someone else’s work and told that I have to use it, especially when I do not believe it is what my students need. I don’t like being in an environment where I have more students than I can individually help and bond with, especially when I am forced to rush them through material that is over their heads just to check a box. I don’t know if I have simply always had a problem with authority or if I just need a wide berth of creative space or maybe it is both. When an authority figure treats me with respect and values my contribution, when they are someone who leads by example and doesn’t go out of their way to lord over me and make me feel inferior, I don’t have a problem. I enjoy supporting them. But I just have a hard time being in a system...my classroom, to me, is my space to fill up with my energy and my creativity and through my own training and knowledge, to ascertain and meet the needs of my students with the same verve and care that I have for the education of my own children. It’s my creative space. And it isn’t evaluations or accountability I disdain...these show me how I can grow and be better, which I always desire constantly to do...it’s just there’s a difference to me of this being an act that is respectful as opposed to an act that is someone essentially trying to squash me to bolster their superiority. 

Anyway. This is my rant. If anyone wants to downvote me, be a dick, go ahead. I’m just trying to process my feelings in a place where hopefully there may be someone who can relate to anything I’ve shared or maybe has gone through something similar and has come out better.",Teachers,t5_2qqcs,I think I hate teaching in a public school and I may resign at the end of this year,0.0,1.0,Policy &amp; Politics,,,,,rant

Like many teachers, I’ve  casually begun starting to explore options working in EdTech.  Probably never will make the jump but just reading up on whether it would even be advantageous.

I’m wondering if anyone can help shed some light on the pros and cons. 

Salary
I’ve noticed that very few EdTech companies ever post salary information.  I’m curious to know how much you can make in EdTech.  I did see a posting for a “Community Manager” at one well-known EdTech platform that would be a pay cut.  

Career Advancement:
You’re limited as far as career advancement in education.  Become an administrator or stay at the same level your entire career.  It seems that working in EdTech would be a big advantage here.  Plus with experience there would be other companies you could work for and get a raise in the process.  Move from district to district as a teacher is usually a lateral move.

Job Security:
This depends but IMO teaching has an advantage.  Most states have unions which allow teachers to be vested into the system. It’s not uncommon for a teacher to work at one school their entire career.  In a corporate atmosphere you can be dismissed for any reason, any time.

Job stress
This one I’m not sure of.  Plenty of teachers are stressed out.  But then again, most have decent job security which helps the situation a bit - at least for me.  Not sure how this compares to working in EdTech.  

Work/Life Balance:
On paper this should favor teaching.  Contract hours can be less than a typical 9-5 position.  But I know that many teachers work longer than contract hours.  Also, teachers likely have more days off than they would have vacation time.   So I’m not sure.",Teachers,t5_2qqcs,Pros and Cons of leaving Teaching and working in EdTech,0.0,1.0,Resignation,,,,,career at edtech

It's a conferencing platform set up for companies to remote in 1 - 2 people, or to host webinars of hundreds. It was definitely not designed for children. (what sensible adult would post their work link on discord?!)

Anyway for those of you being forced to use zoom, here's a list of features I find helpful, organized by how I used them. Please feel free to add things you found useful!

&amp;#x200B;

**Safety/Privacy features - most of these can be found when setting up meetings** 

* Webinar setting - makes it so that only host can turn on video mic, but participants can chat
   * Disabling cameras or mic but not necessarily both if you still want participation
* Waiting room - you manually let people in
* Allowing only verified accounts - blocks people who just have a link and no account. If someone zoomBombs you with an account you can report that account and get them banned
* Recording for your own protection (and blocking others from recording)

**Classroom management**

* disable all mics - a quick way to shut down chatter and get everyone's attention
* pinning the presenter - kids will always see you
* limiting chat options - you have the option to turn off all chat or student to student chat.

**Participation**

* raising virtual hands - hosts get a notification if question is being asked
* reactions - i use for formative feedback and can quickly scan my gallery of kids 
* white board - use to write and kids can add in 
* annotations - kids can add notes to your slides 
* break out rooms - preassigning kids to their table groups for group work 
* screen share - I make slides and teach almost exclusively from them digitally. Later I share the slides with my kids so they can go over it

Also - you don't need internet! Families who don't have a stable connection can call in and join the class that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a tool being used for not at all it's intended reason, I think it deserves a hell of a lot more credit than we're giving it... and I image their engineers are working around the clock to adapt their platform, as they are also being locked down. There's probably teams of computer programers working from trying to update or add options when their neighbors are all using tons of bandwidth streaming netflix... They've already quietly rolled out safety features in their last update.

First of all, I'm not a teacher and I appreciate every teacher's work. I can imagine the struggle of not being just the teacher, but also being in countless of other job positions as a teacher.

I'm a computer science student and found this subreddit by chance.

An old idea that I've had since some time came back into my conscious part of my mind. An idea that should rather be called an advice.

Please do not use Zoom. There are better alternatives like Discord and jitsi.

Why use an video conferencing software that no one's have ever heard of before, inconvenience (time limit) and lack of privacy (affiliation with Facebook and no end to end encryption)?

Discord on the other hand is a very popular and powerful tool that students use in their private time when they are gaming, studying at home and gathering for endless other activities.

It has no limits. You can set the limitations up by yourself.

But a negative aspect of Discord is also the lack of privacy.

From a privacy standpoint, I would recommend going with jitsi or at least doing a proper research before using a tool.

From a convenience standpoint, I would recommend going with discord. Your students will love you (At least I hope so).

1. Feels like an invasion of privacy for them and I. My whole career I've been told to not contact my students via text or phone, much less video chatting with them. Now that's all out the window? I want my home to be a completely student-free sanctuary.
2. I don't want the slim chance of someone hacking into the session and showing inappropriate things (or students doing that). I would be devastated if that happened and feel guilty for a REALLY LONG TIME (even though it clearly wasn't my fault).
3. Would I want my own child to participate in this? Not sure...
4. I don't want anyone recording the sessions and doing god knows what with it.
5. It feels too much out of my control and unpredictable. I can control things safely in my classroom. I can't control what a morning-drunk abusive parent would do on screen.

A Zoombomber went into my colleague's Zoom room the other day. She's part of the elementary school department. The Zoombomber annotated the crap out of the shared screen and kept on saying obscene stuff. The elementary kids were kinda scared and after some minutes, my colleague dismissed the rest of the students. Before leaving, the Zoombomber said something like ""Say hi to Youtube.""

This reached the parents and our school admin had to call for a special debriefing session. She was almost sacked/demoted, though I talked them out of it, and the admin has considered giving her a salary deduction after the incident. I am still defending her as of now and trying to convince the admin to also retract the salary deduction. Fortunately, she isn't super poor, but she is definitely experiencing some financial struggles.

There are YouTube channels who post these kinds of vids of them Zoombombing classes and doing inappropriate stuff like swearing, going topless, showing porn, etc. The most disappointing thing is that freaking **adults** are doing these and not just edgy teens. What I find more disgusting than the Zoombombers are the people who support this stuff.

Some things to consider:

1. To those who might say ""It's her fault for not knowing how to use Zoom!"" Doing online classes on Zoom is already a huge and sudden adjustment for teachers. While some of us learn it quickly, some older teachers have to work twice as hard in learning the ropes in addition to planning out every single lesson. Features like the Waiting Room are still rather new to some teachers. You invading Zoom is an unnecessary disruption and is extra work for them. Don't blame the teacher for your lack of decency.
2. When you start swearing or showing porn during a class of middle schoolers, teachers will have to debrief the kids afterward and if word reaches the parents, there's a lot of explaining to do. You can laugh all you want, but just know that this kind of prank forces teachers to clean up after you in addition to their already stressful job of preparing the lessons.
3. To those who say ""tHaT's ThE iNtErNeT. eXpEcT tRoLlS"": You aren't invading Reddit or 4chan wherein posts are meant to be seen by the world. You're invading a Zoom meeting room, which is meant to have a limited audience. You invading it isn't part of ""internet culture""; it's breach of privacy.

Pranks may be fun and all, but please be considerate of those on the receiving end. Be aware that this kind of prank forces already-stressed-out people to clean up after you and puts their CAREER on the line. Stop posting ""I feel bad for teachers who are just doing their job, but this is too funny."" By posting that, you are still incentivizing such pranks and reinforcing social media edgelords to keep on doing it.

Set a background with text on Teams (I think you can do this on Zoom too). I made mine in Google Drawings and saved it as a jpg. Get a privacy slider for your webcam and boom!

I have the advantage of living in a country where they give a two week break for Easter, so right now things have calmed down, but the previous week was as insane as you can imagine... the main problem being teachers just don't know how to communicate effectively through the internet with their students, some have done Facebook Live ""conferences"" (the horror) with at least one incident of a Spanish teacher accidentally putting on a camera filter and of course being screenshotted and made into a meme - but still our principal won't allow any rules to be placed - I suggested banning Facebook for student interactions but I was ignored, yes I live in a third world country where the public system doesn't care about privacy because there are hardly any consequences.

The main problem right now though is that the higher-ups have made us take an online course for Microsoft Teams, a tool that of course none of us have used before. The classes take place in a live setting and then there are multiple activities to complete and send, it's pretty straight-forward and the instructions are clear.  Still, some teachers are struggling to even sign in into the platform, and there were some arguing that the live event never started... they were waiting for it on a OnePage document that contained the instructions - and I guess they didn't read them. I have to work with these people to complete my activities, I need the interactions with them on the platform since we don't have students there right now, I asked a couple of teachers to go into my Team and like the post I made (as was required) and they said they didn't know how to - even after I explained!

The only positives I can say about Google meet is that links can now be generated right in Google Classroom, and they seem to have fixed the issues with Grid view. Other than that, Google meet sucks in comparison to Zoom. And yet my school requires us to only use Google because of the privacy issues with Zoom.

Two features that seem fairly obvious that I can’t possibly fathom why they aren’t available in Google is letting the teacher mute all (I can mute individual students but it’s time consuming and when the internet is slow, it takes forever). Zoom teachers can mute all, so why can’t I do it in Google? Also the ability to turn off the chat!! The chat drives me absolutely crazy. There needs to be a setting to either turn it off, or have students messages be only visible to the teacher and not to each other. I’ve got kids chatting about fortnite and TikTok despite telling them who knows how many times that the chat should only be used if they have a question for me. They continue to use it as if they’re just texting their friends and I am losing my mind. 

We have been in school three days (virtually) and I feel like if those two options were available, my life would be 1000 times easier. 

On a side note, teachers are teaching from the classroom and I can also tell you our bandwidth is NOT strong enough to support that many streams at one time.

But I would still rather do this than the hybrid option that my school wants to implement. My principal wants to come back in October, some at home and some in school. As it stands now, teaching virtually, we have the whole grade level at one time in a meet (50+ kids). That allows both teachers to be in the room- one who is teaching, and other monitoring the chat and stuff and taking attendance. If we come back in this stupid hybrid model, we’d all be doing this by ourselves while also having kids in our room.

I'll also have a TL;DR at the end, since this is a mini-novel.

We are 100% virtual to start the school year. Our district purchased Canvas as our LMS and everything was going well until they automatically cross-listed our courses. (For example, instead of having three separate sections of 12th grade, they put all 83 of my 12th graders in a single Canvas shell.) While that calls for some reorganization on our end, there was an even bigger problem.

All SPED and EL students in co-taught classes were placed in their own Canvas shells. They were completely separated from their peers (which defeats the entire purpose of inclusion) and the co-teachers couldn't see the other students or access the content in the other class shells. This also presented a huge privacy issue, since it would have been very obvious for students as to who the SPED/EL students were. It definitely could have resulted in a class-action lawsuit. Plus, if the district would have tried to fix the issue after the school year started, it would have deleted all their assignments, grades, feedback, etc. in Canvas. This would impact hundreds of teachers and thousands of students.

Although teachers, administrators, and technology coordinators tried to reach out to various entities in the district to get this fixed for over a week, nothing was being done. So based on a ""brilliant idea"" I had at 2:30 in the morning, I contacted a few key members on our School Board with an email outlining all these issues in the clearest terms I could. I hoped it might get some notice and they could discuss it at the next day's SB meeting. And then...

Within hours of sending the email, I received a response from one of the board members saying she had no idea this was happening. Shortly after that, I was copied into an email chain with the heads of the district in a variety of departments asking about this issue with my entire email included. My principal was also copied on the email chain. Other board members also started contacting additional people, demanding answers. An afternoon meeting was arranged. I wanted to crawl into a cave. 

But then the meeting happened and it was FIXED! They had me test a workaround solution and it was successful. They gave the approval to have our school technology leaders share the fix with all teachers in our district impacted by the problem. (I made sure the SB members and various district leaders knew the problem had been resolved.) It's still incredibly surreal and I can't believe what happened, especially since the SB members were so willing to listen and respond. I'm sure I ruffled some feathers along the way, but it's worth it to have the outcome.

TL;DR Our Canvas courses separated all EL/SPED students in co-taught classes for the entire school district. If the problem wasn't fixed before the start of the year, it could have resulted in loss of learning, privacy breaches, lawsuits, and lost student data. I contacted a few School Board members. SB members contacted Big Important People from the district. I was called to a virtual meeting, which resulted in the problem being fixed for the entire district within hours.

It happened during lunch.  We're all virtual in my district right now, so I have been getting a much clearer view of students' home lives than I ever have before.  We have class through Zoom, and this student had been acting up a lot in the morning, turning his screen on and off, walking away without telling me why, dancing in front of the camera, typing tons of gibberish into the chat… I was getting really frustrated when he was ignoring me after a ton of reminders.  I told him we were going to have to have a talk when lunch started.  

So when lunchtime came around I sent the rest of the kids off and I pulled him into a breakout room to talk about it in private.  He wouldn’t say anything to me and I was trying really hard to get him to engage.  I kept the conversation positive and told him I knew this way of learning is tough to handle, and I told him I just wanted to help him come up with some strategies to try and make it easier.  His house has been noisy a lot during class - when he turns on his mic to talk I can hear a TV on, adults having conversations, and his brother is having class in the same room so I can hear his class too.  We (mostly I) talked about using the headphones I sent him in the mail to help with that.  He said he didn’t get the package.  

His mom must have been listening out of sight, because she came on then and told me that they just received it.  It was a pleasant conversation, I thought.  So I said he could get to lunch, and I turned off my camera and microphone.  As soon as I did that she flipped her shit on him.  I guess she assumed that I end our zoom meetings during lunch, but I keep the room open so students don't have to go through the joining process all over again.  She was yelling at him, I don't remember exactly what she was saying but it was scary to me.   Then she said “get me that belt” and before long I heard her hitting him really hard, maybe 7 times.  He was screaming bloody murder, pretty much choking he was sobbing so hard.  She kept yelling at him to shut up or he would get it again.  When lunch was over I got a text from mom saying that he wasn't being any better behaved and that he wouldn't be able to come back for the rest of the day.

I was able to compartmentalize my brain and teach the rest of the day, but after school got out I just lost it.  I called admin and told them what happened, and they said I did the right thing to report it to them.  They told me that I will need to make the final decision about calling social services, and I was all ready to do that.

But I also poured my heart out to some friends because I needed the support, and from that conversation, I got another perspective.  Some of the friends in my group who are African American told me that whoopings are pretty standard in black households, and it probably isn't really abuse.  I have lived a pretty privileged life, and I try hard to remember that when I am working with underserved families.  The last thing I want to do is bring trouble down on a family that is already downtrodden.  His mom has been one of the more involved ones out of my class this year - it’s pretty clear that she cares about his education and wants him to do well.

I teach first grade. I have several behavior plans, multiple IEPs, and my school is by far the lowest income area in an all title 1 district. I was moved to the school this year, at the same time my school was being built.

Our WiFi has been having issues. Some parts of the school don't have lights still, including the bathroom in my classroom. We don't have grass, so I can't do much outside time with the kids. The playground situation is unclear due to contamination risk.

I'm expected to live stream to my virtual learning kids over zoom every day, all day. Zoom was down today, but luckily I was able to get most of my kids on for at least part of the day. I had repeated issues with getting the other programs working for them, partially because parents are pretty lost. 

Introducing myself to my class, getting my little guys to the right classroom, lunch count, bus information, unpacking supplies, teaching procedures, keeping the kids 6 feet apart and masked, running them back and forth to the bathroom, getting cups of water for them because water fountains are banned, all while trying to combat tech issues and interact with my kids on zoom was a literal nightmare. They were so neglected and so confused. My mic on our new technology was having issues on and off and I couldn't get the volume high enough to hear the kids clearly. I kept having to mute myself constantly as a hope for confidentiality and privacy from the parents listening in. Even with trying to mute myself, I found a few times I forgot to and parents probably heard me correcting kids behavior several times. Their streams were lagging due to wifi issues. 

My in person kids were so bored. I feel like a prison guard. They can't do any of the fun things that they got to do in kindergarten and there's not much they can do. This obviously made their behavior problems even worse. I also feel like realtionship building is so much harder in these times, which was previously the backbone to my classroom management. I'm hoping tomorrow goes smoother but I feel so defeated.

I feel like I can't properly supervise my in class kids. I was literally carrying my laptop open around the classroom, while I walked up and down aisles. I had to send some of my kids down the hall to use the bathroom several times and when I literally ran down to check on them, I found a couple of my kids messing around. My brain literally did not have a second to rest. I got probably at least 30 messages from parents and didn't even see some of them until the end of the day. Coworkers were running in and out of my room, asking for help with basic tech issues in a panic because their brains were so fried. I feel like I should be very lucky I don't have any runners or seriously violent kids because this situation is potentially  unsafe. I didn't even have a place to unwind during my break because my teachers lounge is banned and some specials teachers are coming into our rooms. They also need to use our laptops so I literally hid in a co-workers room and did nothing. 

I feel like my only hope is getting my in person kids onto their tablets half the day and getting them on apps. I hate it, but it's the only way I'm going to survive this year and have any attention left for my virtual students.

There has been a lot of discussion over which is the best conferencing software for classrooms and all of the solutions I have seen have flaws. All of the conferencing software has been developed with corporate meetings in mind.  So for classroom purposes, there are features missing.  


Zoom is the most feature rich from a teacher point of view.  It has key features that teachers love:  


* **Waiting Room** \- students are admitted into the room by a teacher. Also prevents unwanted guests
* **Thumbnail video of everyone** \- Everybody can be seen in Zoom up to 49 people, which is enough for you to see all your class at once.
* **Breakout rooms** \- You can send students to smaller rooms, so that they can talk with each other.
* **Built in whiteboards** \- Not unique, but helpful.

However until this crisis Zoom was a small player and so went down a route of user convenience, meaning that you could just send out a link and join a meeting.  With the spotlight on them, this has now changed, by default you need a meeting ID, password and the waiting room is on by default.  


### Why are all of these features important?

When there were relatively few meetings, 9 numeric digits seemed like plenty, but now there are  200 million meetings every day with zoom. Even with a simple brute force attack you might be able to guess a number to zoom-bomb.     
However the password is a good deal more difficult to guess, so it is essential that this is ON.  
Secondly, although a stranger might be able to come into your room by random they are unlikely to have the name of one of your students and so it is important to read every name in the waiting room.  
With these three features setup, security from a teacher point of view is good.

### The Odds

For the mathematically inclined your odds of guessing are: Chances to guess meeting ID: 200,000,000 : 999,999,999Chances to guess password:    1:9999999999  
Once you combine these then the odds of a simple brute force attack are tiny and actually smaller than using a leaked Office 365 account or Google ID to get into a meeting.

### Students complicit

In some cases students have been giving away their personal information and meeting codes.  Therefore an additional security measure is to not give meeting IDs out too long before the meeting.  You can still schedule them, but only share with the students shortly before the meeting,    
Note if students misbehave, it is easy to enough to put them back into the waiting room. Be wary of kicking students out completely, because depending on your setting they will not be able to come back to the meeting.

### Student Guidelines

Like anything else students need to know the rules that will keep them safe and have a smooth classroom. Here are the guidelines I use to run my lessons smoothly:

* I assign a monitor every lesson to let me know if my video and presentation is smooth. They stay on audio for the whole time I am presenting
* In Google Classroom, I ask a question to ensure everyone is active in the class and it helps to make registration smoother (This reduces the time I need to take a registration, because I can see instantly who is not there and ask directly) 
* Students are told to be fully dressed and in a public space in their house.
* Students must use their real names.

### Teacher Tricks

I use these to help students, but also to reduce frustration because that's the surest way to ensure a student doesn't cooperate: 

* I still use Google Classroom for students with weaker internet. 
* I assign one Google Doc for the whole lesson with all the instructions in it, so that students have less screen flicking to do and can follow the flow even if their internet drops out mid-lesson. (Be sure to encourage use of [offline docs](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en).) 
* I use Google Slides with the captions function to help students who are EAL
* I record the lesson locally and upload to an unlisted youtube area. (In Malaysia, students can use Youtube data with 3G very cheaply).  If there is not an incentive to use YouTube, then use Drive instead.
* I use a second screen so that I can see the student thumbnails at all times. (One good feature of Zoom is that even on a single screen you can see active students when screen sharing)

It might be obvious, but please don't share your Zoom classrooms on Social media... Notice how there's no picture of zoom in use here! 

### Alternatives to Zoom

There are quite a few alternatives to Zoom. Internet infrastructure varies and you might find one of these alternatives suitable for you.

* [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) \- Fully integrated into Gsuite, but lacks many of the features of Zoom
* [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams) \- Great for people with Office 365, but teachers who are not used to it have complained that the interface is cumbersome
* [CISCO Web-Ex](https://www.webex.com/webexremoteedu.html) most secure platform, but video performance is variable

These are more for specific purposes, but useful tools none the less: 

* [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/) \- This enables up to 6 people on the call and you can broadcast directly for youtube. A good choice for assemblies and other events where you are going to give information to a larger gathering.
* [Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com/) \- A good way to be able to teach asynchronously
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) \- Consider doing your presentations directly on YouTube. Don't forget you can add questions with [TED ED Lessons](https://ed.ted.com/lessons) or [EdPuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/)

- Meet organizer can keep unauthorized people out, can approve or disallow entrance 
- Meet organizer can kick anyone out of a Meet

To activate these features, you have to make a change to Settings. Once you do, a permanent Meet link is created and places a button on the Classwork tab and a link in the header of the Stream. Anytime you want to activate the Meet, you press the button.

I'm a recent graduate and first year teacher for an E2020 class in a large public school. For those of you who are not familiar with it, it is an online credit recovery class for students who have failed a course (typically) throughout their high school career. I have a large computer lab, with roughly 25 students working on various courses, from Biology to Spanish. It is my job to ensure they are working, help students who need it, unlock quizzes/tests when they get to it (they cannot take quizzes/tests at home) and work with student working online from their homes. 


It is in many ways, a babysitting job, but it requires a teaching degree and certification. I also have an entire class of students who have zero motivation, behavior issues, lack social grace.... etc. 6 hours everyday. It has been rough the last 2 months because I replaced a teacher who had absolutely no control over the students and instilled rules that just about every student has tested me on. Emotionally, I'm drained everyday I come home. 


Onto the issue. Our high school implemented a strict cell phone policy due to the distractions and problems they create in the classrooms. Absolutely no cell phones in class, but they can be used in between classes. If a cell phone is seen, they are confiscated and taken to the office, where the student is supposed to be written up and receive a detention. Most teachers just take it to the office and the student can get it at the end of the day. 


Today, as we were standing by the door ready to leave for the day, a student asked me to take a picture with me at the end of class. She's a sweet heart, but she likes to post everything to social media and I don't want my picture out there. I also HATE how I look because I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and have been struggling with my weight. Two girls I have had issues with, and have confiscated their phones before for having them in class, suddenly took theirs out and showed me some unbelievably unflattering pictures of me walking around the class, leaning over computer screens to look at student questions, etc. Essentially, they zoomed in on my face which gave me a double chin. I was horrified and I realized not only did I not see them take the picture, but I'm guessing they're sending it back and forth to one another to make fun of me. That doesn't bother me as much as them potentially posting it to twitter and allowing the world to see.


Now I get that not all students are going to like me. In fact, many hate me because I'm essentially a Hitler in class in order to maintain it. However, I feel like it is a huge violation of my privacy and I did NOT give them consent (Aside from the fact they were using their phone in class when they shouldn't be.) 


So my question is, what can or what should I do about this? Obviously I need to be more vigilant, but I'm at a loss for how I should handle this situation. These aren't the nice girls you have in class either, and talking to them (and have spoken with their parents) has not gotten through to them. So teachers, can you help a 20 something new teacher out with your words of wisdom?


tldr; I run a credit recovery class with difficult students. There is a no cell phone policy in class, but a couple of the ""mean"" girls took horrible pictures of me when I wasn't looking- specifically of my face and chin fat (I have PCOS). They laughed as they walked out the door and I feel like my privacy was invaded. What should/can I do?

Chegg swears they won't publish your questions after the exam period. Not sure I believe them on that, but couldn't a student just paraphrase the question then and it wouldn't be blocked?

""Dear Professor ,   

As many schools went online in the spring and fall due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to hear increased interest in addressing improper use of Chegg Study®. **In response to concerns about the challenges of administering exams in a remote environment, we've introduced a new proctoring support tool to assist you during assessments.** Honor Shield is simple to use, free and available to all educators at U.S. colleges and universities.   
 

To address this issue, we listened to professors and administrators at schools from across the country. After a successful Beta test with hundreds of professors, we are making an improved version of Honor Shield widely available for use by instructors in the U.S.   
 

Honor Shield provides a way to time delay answers by Chegg experts to specific questions to reduce instances of cheating on exams. As you know, it works by blocking pre-submitted exam questions on Chegg for a period of up to 6 hours defined by the professor.      
 

To use Honor Shield, a professor simply registers online. Once you are validated, you can upload as many exams as you would like in 6-hour time intervals to cover your exam period. We will intercept incoming questions during the exam period and block solutions to questions answered by Chegg experts from students’ view during the exam period.  Users will be presented with a message that the question is unavailable because of an exam in progress.    
 

Based on the feedback we received during the Beta, we have updated the Honor Shield terms of use to clarify that your exam questions will be used exclusively to match questions during the exam. With these new terms, you can rest assured that Chegg will not publish your exam content.   
 

At Chegg, we are committed to academic integrity as part of the learning process. While most Chegg users are hardworking and honest, we still need tools like Honor Shield along with our Honor Code Policy and copyright removal process to combat the misuse of Chegg's services. Honor Shield provides an additional layer of support on top of a range of measures already in place to prevent abuse of Chegg’s platform.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with cheating isn't going away in Spring 2021 given that most classes are going to be virtual again. Also there has been ""concerns"" about privacy with Proctorio even though students have no problem using social media, posting nude photos of themselves, and using smartphones that are probably even more intrusive than Proctorio. I haven't heard of any student telling me that are completely not using their smartphone and disconnecting from social media due to privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have done is made my exams online. I teach STEM, so it involves solving equations. As a result, I made my exams 75% longer than they normally are and significantly more difficult than they would otherwise be and none of it is multiple choice. It is all problem solving. Also I have hide the scores until all sections have take the exams so even if they somehow copied the exam they don't know how they performed until it is over. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the exam, I just show the score, but if you do actually release the exam/results question by question the it is pretty much gone as far as I'm concerned as it will be on Chegg by the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of trying to address cheating, I just assume they will and compensate for it by increasing the length of the exam and making the content harder than it otherwise would be. Being ""more difficult"" is a subjective term and they probably don't actually know the exam is longer than normal. None of these are against University policies.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole Proctorio privacy thing is just bullshit to not have to use it and not get caught. Let's call a spade a spade. If you think your University administration will stick up for you doing the right thing against student complaints, good luck you must still be new.

I was stunned that anyone thought it would be a ""great idea"" to have the ability to surreptitiously turn on someone's camera and watch them without their permission. 

I get the frustration; it's no fun having an online meeting and no one talks or joins in a discussion, but trying to force something that isn't happening and being pissy about when it doesn't materialize into a wonderful teaching moment has to stop. 

Under no circumstances do I require a student to keep their camera on. They are in their home, a private place, that should remain private. My desire for accountability doesn't override their right to privacy. I also know some students feel genuine shame about their living space, compared to the palaces some student's parents have for them. I won't be a part of shaming anyone, so I have a ""cameras are voluntary"" policy.  

If students aren't engaged, it's just as much the instructor's fault as it is the student.

2. If you want students to share their screens in the breakout rooms, set up screen sharing **before** you open the breakout rooms.
3. If students can't share their screen in the breakout room even though Zoom tells you that they can, then have them update to a newer version of Zoom—the older versions of Zoom don't seem to allow students to share their screen in breakout rooms.
4. Go from one breakout room to another, rather than going back to the main room—not only is it much faster, but it also doesn't automatically mute your microphone.
5. Tell students to use the ""ask for help"" button, as the ""raise hand"" icon is only visible within the breakout room.
6. Keep a list outside Zoom (on paper or on a Google Doc if you have TAs or group tutors as co-hosts) of those who have asked for help, so that you can visit the breakout rooms in the order of requests.  Maintain the list between class sessions, so that groups you were unable to visit before they left can be visited first on the next session.  (Zoom does queues for ""raise hand"" but not for ""ask for help"".)
7. During office hours, use breakout rooms whenever someone wants privacy in a discussion—leave the other students in the main room (where they can talk with each other, just like they would when waiting in a hallway).  This is better than the ""waiting room"" which is like being on a phone hold.

As chair of a large department I was given administrative access to all the courses in LMS in our area (not something I requested), and there were many dilemmas I suddenly faced by being able to look at course content, student/faculty interchanges, and faculty engagement without the knowledge of the other faculty members themselves. 

Further, the institution provided no guidance and presumably has no policy about acceptable ""backdoor"" access to faculty/student activities in the LMS. Anecdotal evidence suggests that several layers of administrators above faculty have full access to courses and use that access regularly without the knowledge or consent of faculty. Several conversations with colleagues have led me to believe that this surveillance can have a chilling effect on how free faculty feel to teach they way they prefer or find effective.

In the traditional classroom, all such surveillance would have involved a person sitting in the classroom, a video cam, or open conversations with stakeholders -- so they were transparent.  This kind of access by LMS is completely nontransparent. 

There is a little discussion of this issue online but I don't know of any colleges that have stated policies about who has access and how that access may be used.

I understand that remote learning is new area to many people. It has been difficult for many teachers in adapting. I can say that I had one hurdle after another. I don't have a LMS system to begin with and has left me with minimal ways to deliver assignments to students ( I really want to teach them something as oppose to nothing at all). The administration at the school doesn't take any of the privacy issues such as FERPA, COPPA, and IDEA into consideration (in relations to remote learning). I didn't even know what the privacy issues were until I started reading. 

On two separate occasions,  I was asked to potentially break the terms of service for software in order to teach online. The first one, using Google Classroom without G-Suite. The second, teaching online via Zoom without an education account. The school claims they will accept all liability if anything goes wrong via a verbal conversation. However, after consideration, I doubt the school will take on any liability. Administration refuses to have a contract of liability in writing. 

I was really hesitant to post here, but I feel I have received some amazing advice here. I apologize if this breaks any rules and will remove immediately. I feel like I'm doing the right thing by saying no to using Google Classroom without G-Suite and not using Zoom without an education account. I'm lost and ready to throw in the towel in teaching.

No, nobody hacked the zoom meeting. This is the ever present dance between accessibility and security that we all play on a day to day basis. 

Here are steps I took to control our meetings better. 

* Required users to sign in to join a meeting (can only allow your domains to access)
* Turned off file transfer
* Muted Participants on Entry \*
* Prevent removed participants from rejoining
* Removed the ability for a participant to share their screen \*\*

\*train staff that while they are muted on entry, the host has the option to lock it down further. Go to manage participants, click more at the bottom left, then uncheck ""allow participants to unmute themselves"". 

\*\* I didnt lock this one, just set it as the default. Hosts can click the up arrow by screen share and click ""advanced sharing options"", from there they can change the option under ""who can share"". 

It is vital that you educate your users on the reality and not the hype. Nobody hacked anything, they were either sent the meeting invite, or they stole it. This is why our leadership teams should be locking their devices (pin/fingerprint) that have access to school email and calendar functions. 

Also, if you are hosting a board meeting, for god's sake do not allow the public into the meeting as attendees! Live stream the meeting to youtube or facebook. This could have been prevented by using even a tiny bit of common sense. People are not using the tools the way they are designed. Large events should be webinars or live streamed to a different platform for viewing.

I also setup an email address [""publiccomments@contosso.com](mailto:""publiccomments@contosso.com)"" so the public can interface with the board members. I thought about chat but anything public has the opportunity to become a target for bombardment.

It took forever for me to be able to shut down direct RDP and set up IPSEC VPN.   And for the better part of a year now - I have been pushing the need to enforce 2-step authentication (or any MFA) and to implement an MDM policy on school-owned laptops and personal phones.  I am finally just getting traction and things seem to be rolling along smoothly now - I thought I'd share some of my experiences.  I would think most schools have had all this for years - but I bet a lot of the smaller districts or regional authorities are in the same boat as me - so I thought I'd share.I'd love to hear how other admins facing push-back from administration have tackled this.

TL;DR - People fear change.  Come prepared.  Get Creative.  Dig in.

Heads up - I'm in Alberta, Canada - so a lot of this won't exactly apply .. but I know many states have similar legislation and regulations so hopefully its still relatable.

**Getting buy-in from Administration**

The gist of it is that administration is more than happy to say ""Go for it"" .. as long as it doesn't affect them. As soon as they find out it also applies to them they try to hold it up in any way they can ""We need to consult with staff"" ... ""we need to make a policy for this first"" ...  ""we need to have a meeting with the policy review board before we can make this policy"" ..  exhausting.

Step 1 - Show Efficacy

Google published research that shows how effective basic account hygiene is at preventing account takeovers.  Two factor authentication is 96% effective at preventing most common hacking attempts.

[https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html)

Simply put - if the school is using online services without 2FA / MFA .. its not a question of ""If"" .. its a question of ""When"" ..

Step 2 - Show it is industry standard

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIP) is too often cited as a way to justify things ..  its sad a lot of people simply don't know the act.  Well, I went through the FOIP act ..  I also went through the Provincial School Act (now Education Act) - In both acts, I found nothing in there that specifically mentioned safeguarding accounts or mobile devices.  I did however find two other places that did:

1. The  SIS (PowerSchool) synchronizes with the province using a plugin interface that the province develops.  Other states and provinces have similar things.  I did some digging and turns out there was a provincial document called ""Security Controls for School Authorities"" .. and it requires schools to have multi-factor authentication.  In fact - superintendents already had to sign off that their districts were compliant.  o\_O
2. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has a wonderful set of articles on Mobile Devices and Online Services at work.   [https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/employers-and-employees/mobile-devices-and-online-services-at-work/](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/employers-and-employees/mobile-devices-and-online-services-at-work/)   In it, it states quite plainly:   *Organizations considering BYOD* *need* *to protect the enterprise information* *accessed* *from and residing on employees’ mobile devices*  .. emphasis on ""accessed from""  So even though the teachers are using GSuite which is in the cloud - the devices still need to have BYOD policies and basic security controls.

**2-Step Verification**

The biggest thing to remember about 2-step verification is that you can't enforce it without locking out all the accounts that don't have it.  I gave them a specific timeline to get it done ..  the date came and only one person had enrolled ..  so I turned on enforcement at 9am .. then turned it back off 15 minutes later.  That afternoon I had all but five enrolled.

The hold outs refused to install an authenticator app or give their cell phone number in order to verify their identity.   That's okay - its their personal device - I can't make them.  So the work around for this was to purchase a $20 USD Yubico Key and have them verify their identity using the school phone.  Security keys are MUCH more of a pain than a mobile authenticator app ..  I expect most to start using their phones after the first time they encounter a ""Insert your security key"" prompt.   If teachers start pulling the ""I lost my security key"" gig ..  I'll just give their key to the school administrator and make them come to her everytime they need to authenticate.  It should not be this hard.

I encouraged staff to use the Microsoft Authenticator for both their Google account and their Microsoft account.  I will be moving them off of local domain and purely into the cloud next .. so I figured its probably best to go directly to the MS Authenticator.  It can back up their MFA keys to the cloud too so if they switch their phones - they don't lose everything.

In order to get Google working with the Microsoft Authenticator - it took some playing.   When you initially set up 2-step authentication .. you have to verify yourself and your only options are ""Security Key"" or ""Text Message or Voice Call"".    Where is the mobile authenticator app?   You have to use the text message / voice call method first .. and then you can add a mobile authenticator.  Once that's done, you can remove the phone from the account.   Since Administrators in GSuite can remove 2-Step authentication from an account, its not as vital to have it.

**Mobile Device Policy**

The school is primarily on Google and only uses Windows on the teacher laptops, and at that its primarily just for IT admin stuff ... get the Office 365 licenses assigned and push out inTune policies.

For Windows: The Provincial software agreement includes licenses for A3 which includes Intune and Endpoint management.  For laptops I pushed out a policy to encrypt the laptop drives using BitLocker, storing the keys in the cloud.  I set it up so that users could enroll other devices as long as they had TPMv2 compliant capabilities.  You can use GPO too to auto-enroll them into inTune.  Once that was done I drafted a baseline security policy (bunch of settings that I have dubbed ""secure thy laptop"") .. Microsoft has a lot of articles on best practices for baseline security policies.   I set up the policies for the laptops.  Had the school been using O365 instead of Google, I would have set up a Mobile device policy too.

For GSuite for Education:  In Device Management, I enabled Mobile Management only for the Staff OU.  I set it to ""Advanced"".  I needed to obtain an Apple MDM push certificate so it would work with iOS.  Was used to doing that when we used Meraki - it should be pretty painless for most admins.  Using ""Advanced"" means you have to deal with Google Device Policy .. which is going to kick you again and again .. but I still think its worth the pain.  I then went into Android and iOS settings and enforced the work profile.

So this is where the pain starts.   The user gets a warning that says something to the effect of ""Your organization requires additional security measures"" ..  it then prompts them to install Device Policy .. and flashes warning after warning mentioning things like ""can access personal information""   ""can wipe your device"" ..     Now...  I had exhaustively educated staff on this for a month or so ..  but despite that .. nearly every staff member denied installation of Google Device Policy.  And .. when they already had the school account added to their Gmail, it locked them out of their personal gmail too until they removed the school account.   For the few that accepted it at the initial prompt - it went smoothly and they had virtually no issues.  For the majority that denied it - it was a downward spiral after that.  Needed to manually remove the accounts, manually install the device policy app ..   what a pain.  And the whole time I just couldn't put them at ease about it.  about 40% of the staff (Right now anyway) are saying they simply won't get email from their phone.   Their prerogative.   The way I see it, accessing your school email on your personal device is a privilege not a right - if you want to use it - there are requirements.  Of course - because that wasn't the norm from the beginning - its an uphill battle.

Google also has some nice support articles at :  [https://support.google.com/a/answer/173390](https://support.google.com/a/answer/173390)

For iPhone users (which seem to be the hardest hit by this):  **OS Security and Management**: [https://support.google.com/a/users/topic/9335665](https://support.google.com/a/users/topic/9335665)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what's funny about this whole thing is that a year from now they will know that every time they log into a new device, as well as every few months, they will have to enter a code from their phone.   It will be completely normal to them by that time.  Nobody will notice it or think of it .. and all this pain today will most likely have been overblown for no reason.",k12sysadmin,t5_2wnyn,Pushback when rolling out 2-Step Verification and Mobile Device Policy,0.0,,,,,,,security issue

With the school switching to distance learning we had to give each of our students GSuite accounts and they are using them to access Google Classroom and Zoom. Students do not have email enabled on their OU and almost all the Google Services that could be restricted are.

With that said, I've noticed that students are using Sign in with Google on many sites that we (nor their parents) would approve of them accessing, and certainly not on a school account.

How have you addressed such issues? My searching, and chat with Google Support did not leave me feeling like I had many options. Google suggested going to Security&gt;API Controls&gt;App Access Control: Apps and  changing access on the apps that we want to allow to 'Trusted'. Then to go to Security&gt;API Controls&gt;App Access Control: Google Services and change Gmail/Drive/Calendar/Contacts to 'Restricted: only trusted apps can access as service"".

The problems seem numerous.   
No way of testing to ensure I'm not breaking things (my test environment is my live environment...)  
It doesn't only apply to Students. Staff who have legitimate use would be hindered, with increase workload on me.  
It wasn't presented as a definite solution.

I'm fairly new to teaching using Zoom. The school has migrated to teaching via Zoom online. I have some concerns about teaching online via zoom. The school has a Zoom education account. However, zero guidance has been given in using Zoom to teach. I'm trying to prepare myself for any possible issues I may run into.

I plan to use some of the Settings:

1. Enable waiting room
2. Mute participants upon entry
3. Play sounds when someone leaves or joins
4. Disable Share Screen, Chat, Rename Themselves, Unmute themselves

For Recording Settings:

1. Choose location to save the recording after the meeting ends
2. Record a separate audio file for each participant
3. Optimize for 3rd party video editor
4. Add a timestamp to the recording
5. Record video during screen sharing
6. Keep temporary recording files

By disabling the chat feature, I will hopefully eliminate the possibility of students typing things that are inappropriate in chat. I also plan to ""end all meeting for all"" after teaching instruction time is over. The recording features will be of help in terms of organization in case students need to go back to an assignment or over a lesson they need help in understanding.

Are there any settings I should consider when teaching Zoom online? I read that a feature to record students when they talk is available.  I don't know  if it breaks any privacy issues for FERPA, COPPA, and IDEA (although parents have consented to using Zoom. the majority of students are under 15 years old). I don't know if I should not record students when talking. I believe their is an ""anonymous"" setting in which students screen is blank and no video is recorded of student talking, but have not tested this setting since teaching via zoom has not started at the school yet.
